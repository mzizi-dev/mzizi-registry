/**
 * Releases are classified, and the changelog is ordered across two version eras.
 *
 * Three live defects motivated this, all of which left every gate green:
 *
 *   1. `getChangelogEntries` ordered `changelog` by `released_at DESC`. Ten of
 *      64 rows have no `released_at`, Postgres sorts NULLS FIRST on DESC, so
 *      the changelog opened with 4.1.8 / 4.1.1 / 4.1.2 / 4.1.0 in arbitrary
 *      order and the current release, 1.0.0, sat at position eleven.
 *   2. `getLatestVersion` used the same ordering and returned **4.1.8**.
 *   3. `getChangelogByVersion` used `.single()`. PostgREST answers PGRST116 for
 *      "more than one row" as well as "no rows", and eight versions carry two
 *      or three entries, so `/api/v1/changelog/4.0.31` answered 404 for a
 *      release present three times.
 *
 * Sorting by semver instead of by date fixes none of it — it puts 4.2.0 above
 * 1.0.0, and the version line was deliberately reset (§14). The fix is a
 * `releases` view carrying `line`, so these assertions pin the code to reading
 * that view rather than re-deriving an order.
