/**
 * `/.well-known/security.txt` — the one file read exclusively by someone trying to report a
 * vulnerability responsibly.
 *
 * It shipped for months advertising three URLs that did not resolve: a `Contact` pointing at
 * `nyuchi/design-portal` (403 — the repo had been renamed and this reference was not), a `Policy`
 * at `mzizi.dev/security` (404) and an `Acknowledgments` at
 * `mzizi.dev/security/acknowledgments` (404). Every other gate was green the whole time,
 * because nothing had ever opened the file.
 *
 * These assertions are OFFLINE and structural — they cannot dial a URL, so they cannot prove
 * a link resolves. What they can do is stop the two mistakes that actually happened: naming a
 * repository that is not this one, and pointing at a path this app does not serve. A reviewer
 * still has to check a genuinely new external URL by hand.
