/**
 * A DATA item's node, read against the real `registry.json` and the real files on disk.
 *
 * This is deliberately an integration test rather than a fixture test. The defect it pins
 * could not be reproduced with a fixture, because the fixture would have to invent the one
 * thing that was missing: `readComponents()` derives a component's node from the directory
 * its file lives in, and a data item — `cssVars`/`css`, no file — has no directory. Its node
 * was therefore `undefined`, and `undefined` is not neutral. It dropped `mzizi-tokens` out
 * of `/api/v1/ui?node=1` and out of `mzizi_list_components({ node: 1 })`, so an agent asking
 * the registry for node 1 got the 17 N1 libraries and not the tokens those libraries and 431
 * components are built on — the one item every consumer is told to install first.
 *
 * Reading the real manifest is the point: the manifest is now the ONLY source for a data
 * item's node, so a test that mocks it away tests nothing.
