 * component is one name with several target implementations (§8.9), so
 * `mzizi-seo` is now `mzizi-seo.ts` AND `mzizi-seo.rs`, and `find` returned
 * whichever the filesystem happened to list first. The suite then compared the

 * being right.
 *
 * Ranking here rather than picking one extension keeps the assertion honest —
 * "the bytes the route serves are the bytes in the repo" — while resolving the
 * same file the reader documents itself as resolving. Every component that gains
