// drifted from that at least once.
//
// The platform token files each shipped FIVE minerals and FIVE heritage tones
// against a seven-and-seven system — no sodalite, copper, hematite or kalahari
// — until `scripts/sync-tokens.ts` made the DB the generator's only input. The
// prose drifted separately and later: `lib/tokens/index.ts` carried "TEN
// LISTING THEMES" and "Ten Colors of Africa" directly above a block holding
// fourteen, and two comments still said "five minerals" after the data said
// seven. Nothing failed, because no test asserted a count.
//
// These tests assert the counts, against the artifacts a reader actually
// consumes. They need no network: `palette.generated.ts` is the committed
// snapshot and `pnpm tokens:verify` is what proves it matches the database.

/**
 * "Five African Minerals" is the retired pre-Seven palette name.
 *
 * `__tests__/api/v1/architecture-routes.test.ts` already asserts this — but only
 * against ONE API route's text, so the name survived in fourteen other places:
 * a rendered `<CardDescription>`, a rendered feature list, the published plugin
 * keyword, six strings in `registry.json` (which the shadcn CLI prints after
 * install), and seven comments in the token source itself.
 *
 * A guard aimed at one route cannot see the other thirteen. This one walks the
 * tracked tree.
 *
 * MATCHED CASE-SENSITIVELY, and that is what makes it safe to run repo-wide.
 * The legitimate historical references — "emitted five minerals and five
 * heritage tones against a seven-and-seven system", "every one carried FIVE
 * minerals" — never write the proper noun, so a citation of the retired name and
 * a use of it are distinguishable without a heuristic. That distinction is the
 * whole reason a prose guard is viable here and was not viable for the count
 * claims above.
