/**
 * The plugin manifest is a PROMISE about a running endpoint, and nothing was
 * checking it against the endpoint.
 *
 * It advertised "Mzizi MCP — components, brand tokens, open 3D architecture,
 * skills, changelog" while the portal's own server registered four tools:
 * list_components, get_component, list_collections, get_database_status. Four
 * of the five advertised capabilities did not exist, and the fifth named the
 * RETIRED axis model — the same vocabulary architecture-routes.test.ts already
 * forbids in public/llms.txt.
 *
 * A manifest is the first thing an agent reads and the last thing anyone
 * re-reads, so it drifts silently and is believed anyway.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED. That four-tool server is gone. There is one Mzizi MCP —
 * `mcp.mzizi.dev/mcp`, the `mzizi-mcp` Worker in mzizi-dev/agent-tools — and
 * `mzizi.dev/mcp` is a 308 to it. So the capability check can no longer read
 * the tool list off disk: the source of truth is in another repository.
 *
 * Rather than replace it with a hand-copied list of eleven tool names — which
 * is the drift this suite exists to catch, merely relocated — the local
 * assertions narrow to what this repo can actually verify: the URL it points
 * at, the hosts it may reach, and the vocabulary it uses. The capability claim
 * is checkable at runtime against `mcp.mzizi.dev/catalogue.json`, which is
 * published for exactly this and is deliberately NOT fetched from a unit test.
