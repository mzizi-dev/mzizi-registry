// Copied verbatim from components/registry/n10-documentation/nyuchi-ai-context.rs by scripts/generate-rust-components.mjs.
// That file is the one a human edits; this is the copy `cargo package` can ship,
// because a tarball only carries files under the crate root.
//
// Regenerate with `pnpm rust:generate`. CI runs `pnpm rust:generate:check`,
// which fails if this copy and its source have drifted.

//! Mzizi N10 documentation — the context window an AI assistant is given.
//!
//! The Rust implementation of `nyuchi-ai-context`. Pure string assembly, no
//! framework, exactly as the `.ts` describes itself.
//!
//! # The defect this port had to confront
//!
//! The `.ts` opens with, in capitals: "This lib never hardcodes counts. Counts
//! drift as the ecosystem evolves." It then hardcodes the entire node set as a
//! literal string — a ten-row table, N1 through N10, with a four-axis model above
//! it. Both are stale:
//!
//!   * The node set is **uncapped** (§9) and runs past N10. N11 is the discovery
//!     rung and N12 the skills rung; neither appears. An assistant handed this
//!     context is told, in a document whose whole purpose is to be believed, that
//!     N10 is the end.
//!   * The horizontal / vertical / depth / outlier axis model is the retired
//!     layer-and-axis scheme. `nyuchi-seo`'s own header records being moved off
//!     N6 "because the layer/axis model is retired in favour of the DNA double
//!     helix".
//!
//! A count is not special. A hardcoded node LIST drifts the same way a hardcoded
//! node COUNT does, and this file proves it: the count rule was followed and the
//! list beside it went stale anyway.
//!
//! So the node map here is **data**, not a literal. [`NodeEntry`] rows are passed
//! in, the same way counts are, and [`current_nodes`] is a documented default for
//! a caller with nothing better — not a truth buried in a string. A caller that
//! reads `/api/v1/architecture` gets a map that cannot go stale at all.
//!
//! # Preserved rather than "fixed"
//!
//! The ten rules are reproduced as written, including rule 8's "48px minimum".
//! `scripts/validate-registry.mjs` records at length that the shipped primitives
//! never honoured the 56px/48px scale and that density won — but the rules block
//! is doctrine text owned by N10's authors, and silently editing what the system
//! tells an assistant about itself is not a porting decision. Flagged here, and
//! left for whoever owns §8.2 to settle.
//!
//! Rule 9's "Query get_node_counts()" and the Supabase/MCP footer are likewise
//! reproduced. They name a specific database and endpoint, which is exactly the
//! kind of fact that rots — see [`Endpoints`] for how a caller overrides them.

3. N2 primitives never import useNyuchiHarness.
4. N3 brand components always destructure { log, motion, LiveRegion } from useNyuchiHarness.
5. N6 pages: pure composition, semantic CSS vars only, accept children/slots.
6. All interactive components: data-slot + data-portal attributes required.
7. Status colors use semantic tokens: --status-success, --status-error, --status-warning.
8. Touch targets: 48px minimum. Focus rings: focus-visible:outline-2.
9. No hardcoded numbers in code or copy. Query the live counts.
