//! NYUCHI DEEP LINK HANDLER — N7 shell, Dioxus.
//!
//! The Rust sibling of `nyuchi-deep-link-handler.tsx`: match an incoming URL against a list
//! of routes and dispatch the first one that fits.
//!
//! # What is actually being ported
//!
//! The `.tsx` component is thin — `<div>{children}</div>` plus two `useEffect`s wiring
//! `window.addEventListener` for `popstate`/a custom event and the initial URL. Browser event
//! wiring is not something a registry crate can usefully abstract across Dioxus's web/desktop/
//! mobile targets without guessing which one the consumer is building for. What is genuinely
//! portable, and what this actually ports, is the MATCHING ALGORITHM: given a URL and a route
//! table, which handler fires and with what captured parameters. [`resolve`] is that function,
//! fully unit-testable with no DOM. The `#[component]` wrapper renders the same
//! `data-slot`/`data-portal` div and takes the resolved outcome as a prop, so a host wires
//! its own event source (`window.addEventListener`, a router's location, a deep-link intent
//! on mobile) and calls [`resolve`] itself.
//!
//! # A silent-failure mode in the TypeScript, not reproduced
//!
//! For a `RegExp` route (as opposed to a `":param"` string pattern), the `.tsx` requires
//! `match.groups` to be truthy before calling the handler:
//!
//! ```text
//! const match = url.match(route.pattern)
//! if (match?.groups) { route.handler(match.groups); return }
//! ```
//!
//! A plain `RegExp` with no named capture groups — `/^\/settings$/`, say — matches the URL
//! but produces `groups: undefined`, so the condition is false and the route is treated as
//! not matching at all. A route with a literal pattern and no params can never fire, and
//! nothing says why: it falls through to `onUnmatched` exactly as if the URL were unrelated.
//!
//! [`RoutePattern::Regex`] does not require named groups: a bare match is enough, and
//! [`Captures`] is empty when there are none. A route with no params behaves like a route
//! with no params, not like a route that silently does not exist.
//!
//! **The `.tsx` sibling still has this.**
