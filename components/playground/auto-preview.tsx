/**
 * Renders a registry component directly from its file on disk.
 *
 * The playground has 23 hand-written demos against 571 components, so 548 items
 * offered a Code tab and nothing to look at. Hand-writing the other 548 is not a
 * plan; rendering the real component is, and it is only possible because component
 * source lives on disk now (docs/component-source-migration.md) rather than in a
 * database column.
 *
 * It renders with SAMPLE DATA, not with invented props, and the distinction is the
 * whole design. This component used to pass nothing at all, on the stated principle
 * that a preview built from guessed props shows the consumer something that is not
 * the component. That principle is intact:
 *
 *   * A GUESS invents a value to satisfy a type — `title: "Title"`, `count: 1`. What
 *     it renders tells you nothing about whether the component works.
 *   * SAMPLE DATA is a record of the shape the component was designed to display,
 *     from a curated set that mirrors the production MongoDB validators field for
 *     field (lib/samples/types.ts). A place card rendered against a real place
 *     document is the component doing its actual job.
 *
 * `resolvePropsFor` only supplies a value when it can identify the prop confidently,
 * by declared type first and name second. What it cannot identify it leaves absent,
 * so the component shows its own empty state rather than a fabricated one.
 *
 * A hand-written demo still wins where one exists. This is the floor, not a
 * replacement: a demo shows a component in a composition, which no resolver can.

/**
 * Only `.tsx`. The extension is appended to the dynamic import below so webpack builds
 * its context over `.tsx` files ALONE — a context matching every extension pulls in
 * `.ts` modules like `mzizi-docs-api.ts`, which reach `lib/registry-source.ts` and
 * therefore `fs`, and the client build fails on module-not-found. Narrowing the context
 * is the fix; filtering after the import is too late, because webpack has already
 * decided what to bundle.

/**
 * Pick the component to render from a module.
 *
 * Preference order matters. The registry convention is a named export matching the
 * component's PascalCase name (`button.tsx` exports `Button`), so that is tried
 * first; `default` is the fallback. Picking the first export alphabetically would
 * render a sub-part — `CardHeader` instead of `Card` — which looks like a broken
 * component rather than the wrong pick.
