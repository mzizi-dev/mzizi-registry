/**
 * Doctrine, read from disk.
 *
 * Doctrine lives in `content/doctrine/<collection>/<slug>.mdx` as YAML frontmatter
 * plus a prose body (CLAUDE.md §15.17). Nothing here touches Supabase: once the
 * content is a file, routing it back through the database adds a network hop, a
 * failure mode, and a second copy that can disagree with the first.
 *
 * This replaces the eight `architecture_*` reads in `lib/db` that pointed at tables
 * which **do not exist** in the project — `architecture_principles`,
 * `architecture_framework`, `architecture_data_layer`, `architecture_cloud_layer`,
 * `architecture_pipeline`, `architecture_data_ownership`, `architecture_sovereignty`
 * and `architecture_removed`. Every one of them returned an error, which is what
 * made four live routes answer 500. A file cannot go missing without the build
 * noticing, which is the whole argument for the move.
 *
 * Frontmatter is parsed with a deliberately small reader rather than a dependency:
 * every file was written by one extractor (`scripts/extract-doctrine.ts`, the
 * one-time move out of Supabase, since deleted with the database), so the shape is
 * predictable. New doctrine is authored by hand in that same shape;
 * `pnpm doctrine:generate:check` catches a file the generated module no longer matches.
