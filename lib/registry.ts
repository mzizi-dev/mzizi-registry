/**
 * The component registry, read from the repo.
 *
 * A component is a REAL FILE — `components/registry/n<N>-<label>/<name>.<ext>` — which
 * the build compiles and typechecks. That is the whole point: an error in a component
 * fails `pnpm build`. There is no per-component JSON document and no database row; both
 * are representations of a component rather than the component, and both can drift from
 * the code while still looking correct.
 *
 * Two files, and only two:
 *
 *   components/registry/n<N>-<label>/<name>.<ext>   the component itself, 571 of them
 *   registry.json                                   the shadcn manifest, 571 items
 *
 * `registry.json` is the manifest a consumer's `npx shadcn add` resolves against, so it
 * has to exist as one document in the shadcn schema. It is NOT a second copy of the
 * components: it carries the install contract (description, dependencies,
 * registryDependencies, target paths) and never the source.
 *
 * The node is derived from the directory the component lives in, so it cannot disagree
 * with where the file actually is.
