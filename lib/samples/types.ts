/**
 * Sample-data types — the shapes Mzizi components render against.
 *
 * THESE ARE NOT INVENTED. Each mirrors a MongoDB collection validator on the live
 * platform cluster, field for field, at the subset a UI actually reads:
 *
 *   SamplePlace   → places.places          (schema.org Place, `_schemaVersion` v3.2)
 *   SampleEntity  → entity.entities        (schema.org Organization, the bundu trust block)
 *   SamplePerson  → identity.persons       (OIDC claims + bundu)
 *   SampleEvent   → events.events          (schema.org Event, iCal fields)
 *   SampleProduct → commerce.products      (schema.org Product, Offer[])
 *   SampleArticle → news.articles          (schema.org NewsArticle)
 *
 * That correspondence is the entire point, and it is what makes this more than
 * lorem ipsum. A consumer wiring `mzizi-place-card` to their own
 * `places.places` collection has the mapping already done, because the component
 * was built against a document of exactly that shape. Getting a preview working
 * and getting a consumer's integration working stop being two jobs.
 *
 * WHY A CURATED SET RATHER THAN READING THE PRODUCTION COLLECTIONS.
 *
 * Measured, not assumed. `places.places` holds 15,359 documents; **38** have a
 * description and **zero** have `media`. They are bare OSM name-and-geometry
 * imports. `events.events` holds one document. `commerce.products` holds two.
 * A place card rendered against production is a grey box with a name on it —
 * there is no data to preview against, so the choice is not "curated vs. real",
 * it is "curated vs. nothing".
 *
 * Three further reasons it stays curated even once production fills up:
 *
 *   1. **Publishing.** mzizi.dev is public. Production records are real people,
 *      real businesses and unverified community reports; `places_public` exists
 *      as a view precisely because some fields must not leave the cluster. A
 *      design-system preview is not the place to make that call implicitly.
 *   2. **Stability.** A preview that changes because someone edited a production
 *      row is not a preview. Screenshots, visual diffs and docs all need the
 *      same bytes tomorrow.
 *   3. **Coverage.** Real data clusters around the easy case. A fixture set is
 *      chosen to break things: the name with no image, the 200-character title,
 *      the zero-review business, the sold-out product, the cancelled event.
