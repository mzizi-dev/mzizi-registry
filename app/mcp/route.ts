/**
 * `mzizi.dev/mcp` — retired, 308 to `mcp.mzizi.dev/mcp`.
 *
 * There is ONE Mzizi MCP now. This route used to be a second one: the same
 * registry, a smaller tool set, no authentication, served in-process by the
 * portal. Two endpoints over one corpus is two tool catalogues to keep in step,
 * two auth stories to explain, and a silent choice for every client author —
 * and the two had already diverged (four tools here against eleven there).
 *
 * 308 rather than 301 or 302 on purpose: it is the only redirect status that
 * guarantees the method and body survive the hop, so an in-flight JSON-RPC
 * `POST` reaches the real server instead of arriving as a bodyless `GET`. The
 * MCP Streamable HTTP clients in use here follow it on `fetch`.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COSTS, SAID PLAINLY. Anonymous access to the Mzizi registry over
 * MCP ends here. `mcp.mzizi.dev/mcp` sits behind WorkOS AuthKit — a free
 * signup, not a paywall, but a signup where there was none. Anything that
 * needs an unauthenticated read still has `api.mzizi.dev/v1` (open, no key)
 * and `mcp.mzizi.dev/catalogue.json` for the tool list.
 *
 * Keep this route. Deleting it would 404 every client configured against the
 * old URL, which is a worse answer than forwarding them.
