/**
 * GET /.well-known/security.txt
 *
 * RFC 9116 security contact disclosure.
 * https://securitytxt.org/
 *
 * EVERY URL HERE IS TESTED, because this file previously advertised three that were not:
 *
 *   Contact          github.com/nyuchi/design-portal/security/advisories/new   403 — wrong repo
 *   Policy           mzizi.dev/security                                        404
 *   Acknowledgments  mzizi.dev/security/acknowledgments                        404
 *
 * A security.txt is read by exactly one kind of person: someone who has found a
 * vulnerability and is trying to tell us before they tell anyone else. Sending them to a
 * 404 spends the goodwill that got them here, and it advertises a disclosure process that
 * does not exist — which is worse than publishing no file at all, because a missing file
 * reads as "not set up yet" while a broken one reads as "set up and ignored".
 *
 * `Policy` now points at SECURITY.md in the repository, which exists and is the actual
 * policy. `Acknowledgments` is REMOVED rather than repointed: there is no acknowledgments
 * page, and RFC 9116 makes the field optional. Absent is honest; a link to nothing is not.
 *
 * THE ORG SLUG IS LOAD-BEARING. Both GitHub URLs name `mzizi-dev/mzizi-registry` in full.
 * `nyuchi/mzizi` — what they said before — still 301s here, so it looked fine; a redirect that
 * only holds while nobody reclaims the name is not what a disclosure contact should rest on.
 * And the tempting shortening, `mzizi-dev/mzizi`, is a DIFFERENT repository: the Mzizi language
 * (the Rust compiler). A report filed there would land in front of the wrong maintainers.
 * The registry keeps its `-registry` suffix everywhere.
 *
 * `__tests__/api/security-txt.test.ts` asserts the shape offline, and every URL was checked
 * by hand against production before this landed.
