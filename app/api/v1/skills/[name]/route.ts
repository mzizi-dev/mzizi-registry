 * GET /api/v1/skills/[name]

 * One skill in full, including `body_mdx`. 400 on a name that is not
 * kebab-case, 404 when no such skill exists.
 *
 * Served from `@nyuchi/mzizi-skills` rather than Supabase — see `lib/skills.ts`.
 * The name pattern is kept even though the lookup is now an in-memory find:
 * rejecting a malformed name with 400 rather than 404 tells a caller their
 * request was wrong, not that the skill is missing.
 *
 * The body is content an agent will act on, so it is cached 1h public / 1d
 * shared. It can only change with a deployment now, which makes that cache
 * strictly safer than it was against a live table.
