/**
 * GET /api/v1/architecture/layers/[n] — HTTP 410 Gone.
 *
 * Retired with the layer era. This route wrapped
 * `get_layer_detail(p_layer_number int)` and served an **`axis_name`** on
 * every row, behind a `1-10` bound that rejected any node above ten. Both
 * halves were the retired model: nothing belongs to an axis because there
 * are none, and the node set is never capped — that bound is exactly what
 * made N11 unreachable.
 *
 * Replaced by `/api/v1/architecture/nodes/{n}`, which reads the helix
 * collection the MCP serves and takes no upper bound. The rename is not
 * cosmetic: the `layers` segment was previously kept "for URL stability",
 * and a stable URL serving retired vocabulary is how this drift spread.
 * Consumers get a `migrated_to` pointer rather than a bare 404, the same
 * way `/api/v1/docs*` and the axis routes do.
 *
 * The SITE path `/architecture/layers/{n}` is a permanent redirect to
 * `/architecture/nodes/{n}` (see `next.config.mjs`) — a human following an
 * old link lands on the page, while a machine reading the API contract is
 * told plainly that the shape changed.
