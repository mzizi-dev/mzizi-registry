/**
 * GET /api/v1/architecture/axes — HTTP 410 Gone.
 *
 * The axis model is retired. Mzizi serves the **DNA double helix**: nodes on an
 * engineering backbone and a meaning backbone, held by cross-cutting rungs.
 * There are no axes, no outliers, no 3D and no X/Y/Z (§6.2).
 *
 * This route wrapped `get_axes_summary()`, which returned four rows —
 * horizontal / vertical / depth / outlier — with `node_count` and
 * `component_count` zeroed on every one, because the joins behind it stopped
 * resolving after the helix migration. It served a retired model *and* hollow
 * numbers.
 *
 * Retired rather than remapped: emitting strand data through a field named
 * `axis_geometry` would look correct and teach the wrong model to every
 * consumer that read it, which is how this drift started. Absence is the
 * correct state for anything axis-shaped, not repair.
