/**
 * GET /api/v1/architecture/frontend/layers — HTTP 410 Gone.
 *
 * Retired with the axis model. This route served `layerNumber` / `subLabel` /
 * **`axisName`** per row — layer-era vocabulary, with each entry naming the axis
 * it belonged to. The model is nodes on strands plus rungs; nothing belongs to
 * an axis, because there are none.
 *
 * The replacement is `/api/v1/architecture/nodes/{n}` for per-node detail and
 * the MCP `get_node_documents` for the live node/strand documents. The
 * `layers/{n}` path this once pointed at is itself now 410: keeping a `layers`
 * segment "for URL stability" left the retired vocabulary in the contract.
