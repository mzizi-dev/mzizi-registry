/**
 * GET /api/v1/architecture
 *
 * Full snapshot of the Mzizi DNA double helix — every node and rung with
 * its covenant, stakeholder, implementation rules and live component
 * count, plus the strands that group them by backbone. Single call powers
 * the explorer page at `/architecture`.
 *
 * Reads `component_documents` / `documentation-architecture-{nodes,strands}`
 * via `getHelixModel()` — the same source of truth the MCP serves. Counts
 * come from `get_node_counts()` and are never hardcoded.
 *
 * This route previously reshaped the `get_architecture()` RPC into a
 * nested `axes[].layers[]` payload with an `axis_geometry` field and an
 * `axes_count` in `meta`. That model is retired: there are no axes, no
 * outliers, no 3D and no X/Y/Z (§6.2). `openapi.yaml` has documented the
 * helix shape here since the axis routes were retired, so this is the code
 * catching up to its own published contract — not a new contract.
 *
 * `get_architecture()` is separately known to return no rows in
 * production. Nothing here fabricates a fallback: an empty model returns
 * `200` with empty arrays and `meta.empty: true` so a consumer can tell
 * "the collection is empty" from "the request failed".
