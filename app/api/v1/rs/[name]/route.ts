/**
 * GET /api/v1/rs/[name] — a component's RUST (Dioxus) implementation.
 *
 * TWO SURFACES OVER ONE COMPONENT, NOT TWO COMPONENTS.
 *
 * `button` is one registry item with one contract — one description, one dependency list,
 * one set of documented variants — implemented for React in `button.tsx` and for Dioxus in
 * `button.rs`, side by side in the same node directory. `/api/v1/ui/{name}` serves the first
 * and stays byte-identical to what it has always served, so every existing `npx shadcn add`
 * keeps working; this route serves the second.
 *
 * A separate `button-rust` registry entry was the obvious alternative and is wrong: two
 * entries can drift in description, variants and dependencies while both look correct, which
 * is precisely the class of defect this repo has spent the whole migration removing.
 *
 * A COMPONENT WITH NO RUST SIBLING IS A 404, DELIBERATELY.
 *
 * Most of the registry is TypeScript-only today. Answering 200 with an empty body — or
 * falling back to the `.tsx` — would tell a Dioxus consumer that a Rust implementation
 * exists when it does not, and CLAUDE.md §8.9 is explicit: never present a target as though
 * components exist for it when the honest answer is "the source is yours to write".
 *
 * THIS IS A READ SURFACE, NOT AN INSTALL PATH.
 *
 * `npx shadcn add` copies a file into a consumer's project. Rust has no equivalent and does
 * not need one — a Dioxus consumer depends on the `mzizi-ui` crate (CLAUDE.md §8.9). This
 * route is for reading: an agent answering a question, a reviewer, someone porting a
 * component. The shadcn-shaped envelope is kept anyway so one client can parse both routes.
