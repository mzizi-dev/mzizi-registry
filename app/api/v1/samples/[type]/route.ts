/**
 * GET /api/v1/samples/[type] — the sample records of one type.
 *
 * Types: `places` | `entities` | `persons` | `events` | `products` | `articles`.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR.
 *
 * Every Mzizi component preview renders against these records, so a consumer building
 * against the registry can develop against the same data the component was designed for —
 * without standing up a database first. An agent scaffolding a page can fetch a real place
 * document and see exactly which fields a card reads.
 *
 * The shapes mirror the production MongoDB validators field for field
 * (`lib/samples/types.ts`), which is what makes this more than fixture JSON: the query a
 * consumer writes against `mzizi_samples` is the query they ship against their own cluster.
 * `pnpm samples:push` puts the identical documents in MongoDB for exactly that reason.
 *
 * NOT REAL DATA, AND SAID SO IN THE PAYLOAD. Every response carries `sample: true`. These
 * records are curated fixtures — the places are real, the businesses and people are not —
 * and a consumer must never be able to mistake them for the live registry. Production
 * `places.places` holds 15,359 documents; 38 have a description and none have images, which
 * is why previewing against it was never an option.
