/**
 * The router for `api.mzizi.dev`.
 *
 * Next derives routing from the filesystem at build time. A standalone Worker
 * has no such convention, so the mapping is a generated table
 * (`routes.generated.ts`, written by `scripts/generate-api-routes.mjs`) and this
 * is the matcher over it.
 *
 * The table is ordered at generation time so a literal segment always precedes a
 * parameter that would also match it — `/api/v1/skills/summary` before
 * `/api/v1/skills/:name`. That ordering is why matching can be a linear scan
 * taking the first hit, and why the precedence is visible in the committed
 * artifact rather than hidden in a sort here.

/**
 * A Next route module, seen from the router: HTTP-method exports plus whatever
 * else the file declares (`revalidate`, `dynamic`, …).
 *
 * The members are `unknown` rather than `Handler`, and that is forced rather
 * than lazy. A handler for `/api/v1/skills/:name` is typed
 * `(req, { params: Promise<{ name: string }> }) => …`, and a router holding a
 * table of many routes can only offer `Promise<Record<string, string>>`.
 * Function parameters are contravariant, so the specific handler is NOT
 * assignable to the general signature — declaring `GET?: Handler` makes every
 * entry in the generated table a type error.
 *
 * What actually guarantees a handler receives the params it asks for is the
 * generator: `:name` in the pattern and `{ name: string }` in the handler both
 * come from the directory literally called `[name]`, so they cannot disagree
 * without someone renaming a folder and its own route file's types together.
 * That is a real invariant, and it lives outside the type system — so it is
 * written down here rather than papered over with a lie about the types.
