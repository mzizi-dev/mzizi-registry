// Inline every component's SOURCE into `lib/registry-source.generated.json`.
//
// WHY. `lib/registry-source.ts` reads component files with `readFileSync` at
// request time. It is the last filesystem reader in this app's read path, and
// Cloudflare Workers has no filesystem.
//
// WHY INLINED RATHER THAN SERVED FROM STATIC ASSETS. Static Assets is the shape
// these files arguably want — they are static, served by path. It was rejected
// for now on two grounds, both practical:
//
//   1. It needs an assets binding, which only exists once the Worker does.
//      Building against a binding that is not there yet means writing code no
//      test can exercise.
//   2. It makes every read async. All five call sites are currently sync; three
//      are React server components where that is survivable and two are route
//      handlers where it is trivial — but it is still five call sites changed
//      for a benefit that is invisible until the bundle is near its limit.
//
// The whole corpus is ~0.6 MB gzipped, comfortably inside the Worker script
// limit, so inlining costs budget that is available and buys a change with no
// call-site churn. If the bundle later gets tight, Static Assets is the move,
// and this generator is where it changes.
//
// JSON rather than a .ts module on purpose: `registry.json` (1.1 MB) is already
// imported this way, a JSON import parses faster than an equivalent object
// literal, and it keeps a multi-megabyte artifact out of the TypeScript program.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/generate-registry-source.mjs           write the artifact
//   node scripts/generate-registry-source.mjs --check   fail if stale (CI)
