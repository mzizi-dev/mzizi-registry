/**
 * Extract each component's prop names and types into `lib/samples/props.generated.ts`.
 *
 *   pnpm props:extract        — regenerate
 *   pnpm props:verify         — non-mutating drift gate
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS.
 *
 * `AutoPreview` renders a component in the browser. To hand it sample data it has to know
 * what props the component takes — and the props are a TypeScript type, which does not exist
 * at runtime. So the names and types are read here, at build time, from the source on disk,
 * and emitted as data the client can use.
 *
 * That is only possible because component source is a file in this repo. It was not possible
 * while source lived in a database column, which is a small concrete example of what the
 * migration bought.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY IS NOT.
 *
 * Not a type checker, and not the TypeScript compiler API. It reads prop declarations with a
 * scanner and gives up on anything it cannot read confidently, emitting nothing for that
 * component rather than a guess. A wrong prop type produces a preview that renders something
 * which is not the component — worse than no preview, because it looks authoritative. `tsc`
 * remains the thing that decides whether a component's types are right; this only decides
 * what to try passing it.
 *
 * The output is committed and drift-gated for the same reason the token artifacts are: a
 * generated file that nothing verifies is a file that silently goes stale.
