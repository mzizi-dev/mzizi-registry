/**
 * Project `app/globals.css` into the `mzizi-tokens` registry item's `cssVars`.
 *
 *   pnpm tokens:registry          rewrite registry.json
 *   pnpm tokens:registry --check  fail if it is out of date (CI)
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * N1's covenant is that it is "the only node allowed to define CSS values" and that design
 * decisions are data, not code. The registry contradicted both: `mzizi-tokens` shipped a
 * 50 KB TypeScript file containing ZERO CSS custom properties, and no registry item shipped
 * any CSS at all — not a `.css` file, not `css`, not `cssVars`.
 *
 * The consequence was not cosmetic. 431 of 573 components reference `var(--…)` — 137
 * distinct variables — and `app/globals.css` defines 214 of them. A consumer running
 * `npx shadcn add mzizi-listing-card` received Tailwind classes like
 * `bg-[var(--color-malachite)]` and no definition for `--color-malachite`, so every mineral
 * colour, radius, motion duration and touch target resolved to its fallback or to nothing.
 * The tokens existed; they were simply never delivered.
 *
 * `cssVars` is shadcn's first-class answer (registry-item.json: theme / light / dark). The
 * CLI merges it into whatever stylesheet the consuming project uses, so it is genuinely
 * framework-agnostic — which a `.ts` file cannot be. The TypeScript constants are not lost:
 * they become `mzizi-tokens-typescript`, the seventh platform variant alongside the arkts,
 * kotlin, python, react-native, rust and swift ones that already existed.
 *
 * GENERATED, NEVER HAND-EDITED. `globals.css` is itself generated in part (`tokens:sync`
 * writes the marked blocks from the DB palette), so hand-copying 214 values into
 * registry.json would create a third copy that drifts from both. This reads the CSS and is
 * gated in CI by `--check`.
