/**
 * Normalise `registry.json` — the authored component manifest.
 *
 *   pnpm registry:normalize   — rewrite it in canonical form
 *   pnpm registry:verify      — non-mutating; exit non-zero if it is not canonical
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACED, AND WHY.
 *
 * This script used to REGENERATE `registry.json` from the Supabase `components`
 * view: read every row, project six fields, write the file, and fail CI when the
 * committed copy disagreed. `registry.json` was a snapshot; the database was the
 * source of truth.
 *
 * That is no longer true, and keeping the old direction would now be actively
 * destructive. Component source is on disk (docs/component-source-migration.md)
 * and the manifest carries authored `meta` — use cases, variants, sizes, features,
 * a11y notes — that no database row holds any more. Regenerating from Supabase
 * would silently delete all of it on the next run.
 *
 * So the manifest is AUTHORED. Editing a component's description, dependencies or
 * use cases is a pull request against this file, where a reviewer and a diff can
 * see it — which is the same rule that moved source out of a JSON column.
 *
 * WHAT "NORMALISE" MEANS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHECK.
 *
 * Only canonical FORM: keys sorted, items sorted by name, then Prettier. That
 * makes a diff show what actually changed instead of a reordering, and it is the
 * whole job.
 *
 * Prettier is part of the definition of canonical, not a cosmetic afterthought.
 * `registry.json` is inside the org-wide `lint / prettier` gate's glob (every
 * md, mdx, json and jsonc file), and Prettier collapses a short array onto one
 * line where `JSON.stringify(payload, null, 2)` never does. With the old
 * hand-rolled serialisation, `pnpm registry:verify` and `lint / prettier`
 * demanded two different files and could not both pass. Running the canonical
 * form through Prettier with the repo's own `.prettierrc` makes one formatter of
 * record for this file and removes the deadlock.
 *
 * It does NOT check that items resolve on disk, that dependencies are
 * installable, or that the shape satisfies the shadcn CLI. `pnpm
 * registry:validate` (scripts/validate-registry.mjs) asks every one of those
 * consumer-facing questions, offline, and is the gate that catches a broken
 * install. Two scripts because they answer two questions: this one asks "is the
 * file tidy", that one asks "does it work".
 *
 * No credentials and no network — a missing secret must never be why a
 * malformed manifest ships.
