/**
 * Make `files[].path` mean what shadcn says it means, and move the install destination to
 * `files[].target`.
 *
 *   pnpm registry:paths          rewrite registry.json
 *   pnpm registry:paths --check  fail if it is out of date (CI)
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * shadcn's registry-item schema is explicit about the two fields:
 *
 *   path    the SOURCE location of the file inside the registry repository
 *   target  the DESTINATION path in the consumer's project
 *
 * This registry had it backwards. Every item declared `path: "components/ui/button.tsx"` —
 * the place the file should LAND — and no `target`. The real file is at
 * `components/registry/n2-primitives/button.tsx`.
 *
 * Nothing caught it because our own API never reads `path` as a source: `/api/v1/ui/{name}`
 * resolves the source by component NAME and inlines the content, so the wrong `path` was
 * only ever used by the CLI as a destination hint — and the destination it derives from a
 * `registry:ui` type plus that basename happens to be the same string. Right answer, wrong
 * mechanism, and it only holds while every item's type implies its folder.
 *
 * It is not cosmetic. `shadcn registry validate mzizi-dev/mzizi-registry` fails on all 574 items, and
 * GitHub registries — `npx shadcn add mzizi-dev/mzizi-registry/button`, which needs no API, no worker
 * and no deploy — resolve files straight out of the repository at `path`. With the wrong
 * path, that entire distribution channel is closed.
 *
 * GENERATED, NEVER HAND-EDITED. The source path is a fact about where the file is on disk,
 * so hand-writing it creates a second copy that drifts the moment a component moves between
 * node directories. `--check` gates it in CI.
