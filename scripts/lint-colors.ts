/**
 * Hardcoded-palette-colour lint.
 *
 * The seven minerals and seven heritage tones are the brand palette and must be
 * referenced as tokens — the Tailwind utility (`bg-sodalite`, `text-copper`,
 * `bg-cobalt-container`) or the CSS var (`var(--color-sodalite)`) — never pasted
 * in as a raw hex. This lint fails when a raw hex that EQUALS a known palette
 * value appears outside the canonical token files.
 *
 * The vocabulary is DB-driven: it is read from lib/tokens/palette.generated.ts
 * (itself generated from the DB by sync-tokens.ts), so adding a colour to the
 * store needs no change here. Non-palette hexes (status greens/ambers, chart
 * fallbacks, SVG gradients) are intentionally NOT flagged — this guards the
 * brand palette specifically, not every colour literal.

   * enforces the same §7.4 rule over registry component source and exempts
   * exactly these two by name (`LITERAL_COLOUR_DATA`), because "the hex is the
   * value the component returns, so it has to be a literal: a swatch rendered
   * as `var(--color-cobalt)` cannot report which colour was picked."

   * Two gates enforcing one rule and disagreeing about which files break it is
   * itself a blind spot: `pnpm check` failed on files `pnpm registry:validate`
   * had already cleared, and the two lists had no way to notice each other.
   * These are listed per file, not as an `n2-primitives/` directory, because
   * the exemption belongs to those two components and to nothing else in that
   * layer. The residual — both files RETYPE N1's palette
   * instead of sourcing it, and `color-picker`'s "Terracotta" swatch (#D4A574)
   * is not the terracotta token (#A0522D / #E1B07E) — is recorded in
   * `validate-registry.mjs` and needs the §15.6 self-containment rule relaxed
   * before it can be fixed. Neither gate can see that drift; a hex that is not
   * a palette value is invisible to this one by design.

/**
 * Generated artifacts are skipped entirely.
 *
 * This rule exists to stop a hex being hardcoded in code that should reference
 * a token. A generated file is not code anybody writes — its content is
 * governed by its source, and pointing at the projection tells the wrong
 * person to edit a file whose first line says "do not edit".
 *
 * It is not hypothetical. Inlining the skills bundle put
 * `lib/skills.generated.ts` in `lib/`, and one skill body TEACHES the canonical
 * token block:
 *
 *     --color-terracotta: #a0522d; \/* Community *\/
 *
 * That is the same content as `app/globals.css`, which is on the allow-list
 * above, arriving by a different route — so the linter reported nine
 * violations for documentation doing exactly what the rule wants. `pnpm
 * lint:colors` has been red on `main` ever since, and nothing noticed because
 * it runs only via `pnpm check`, never in CI.
 *
 * The gate is not weakened. A hex hardcoded in a generated file means a hex
 * hardcoded in its SOURCE, and that is where it has to be caught — for skills,
 * in `mzizi-dev/agent-tools`, where the SKILL.md is authored.
