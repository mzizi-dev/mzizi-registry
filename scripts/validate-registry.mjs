/**
 * Validate every registry item against the contract a CONSUMER depends on.
 *
 *   pnpm registry:validate
 *
 * This is the gate that was impossible while component source lived in a
 * Supabase JSON column: nothing could open a component, so nothing could check
 * one. Now that all 571 are files on disk, CI can.
 *
 * It exists because three separate bugs shipped this week while every existing
 * gate stayed green — typecheck, lint, tests, build, the registry snapshot, and
 * the API returning HTTP 200 the entire time:
 *
 *   1. 145 `registryDependencies` were written `@mzizi/<name>`. The shadcn CLI
 *      resolves a dependency as either a bare name (against ui.shadcn.com) or an
 *      absolute URL. `@mzizi/x` is neither, so `npx shadcn add` 404'd for 105
 *      components. Nothing noticed, because the payload itself was well-formed.
 *   2. The source reader took an allow-list of four extensions, so five
 *      multi-language components (`.md`, `.kt`, `.swift`, `.py`, `.ets`)
 *      resolved to nothing on disk and were quietly served from the database
 *      fallback instead — invisible until that fallback was removed.
 *   3. A view predicate hid 249 stable components from `/api/v1/ui/{name}` for
 *      weeks while they stayed visible over MCP.
 *
 * The common shape: a component can be BROKEN FOR A CONSUMER while every
 * signal we had said fine. So this validator asks only consumer-facing
 * questions, and asks them offline.
 *
 * OFFLINE AND CREDENTIAL-FREE, deliberately. It reads `registry.json` and the
 * files on disk — no database, no network. A missing secret must never be the
 * reason a broken component ships, and a gate that skips when unconfigured is a
 * gate that trains people to ignore it.

 * written when §8.2 declared a 56px default and a 48px "non-negotiable"
 * minimum. §8.2 has since recorded that the shipped primitives never did that,
 * that the doctrine described a system which did not exist, and that density
 * won: the scale is `h-8` small, `h-9` default, `h-10` large. So the check
 * flagged the exact sizes doctrine now mandates, on 125 components — and a gate
 * that calls correct code wrong is why nobody read this output, with 85
 * genuinely broken install paths sitting in the same list.
 *
 * Narrowing it to "below `h-8`" was tried and is worse: 146 warnings, because
 * the pattern greps the whole FILE for a size class and for `onClick`, so
 * `<ArrowLeft className="size-4" />` inside a button counts as an undersized
 * control. A file-level regex cannot tell an icon from the control containing
 * it.
 *
 * And the rule §8.2 actually states is not about the number at all: a dense
 * control on a touch surface must "earn its hit area some other way —
 * surrounding spacing, or padding the interactive area beyond the visual box."
 * That is a question about rendered layout. Answering it needs a rendered tree,
 * which belongs in the a11y audit, not in an offline manifest validator.
 *
 * Leaving it out is the honest state. Re-adding a regex version would restore
 * the noise that hid the real findings.

/*
 * There is deliberately NO allow-list of "real upstream primitives" any more.
 *
 * There was one — `SHADCN_PRIMITIVES`, ~60 names — and the rule beside it said a bare
 * `registryDependencies` entry is "CORRECT for these and wrong for anything Mzizi-only".
 * That rule is why 567 edges across 41 names shipped bare, and all 41 of those names are
 * items in THIS registry.
 *
 * The premise was wrong. A bare name does not mean "take the upstream one where an upstream
 * one exists" — the CLI resolves every bare name against ui.shadcn.com, full stop. So
 * installing `nyuchi-listing-card` from production pulled shadcn's badge (1776 B), card
 * (1987 B) and avatar (2916 B) instead of ours (1909 / 4306 / 3429): a brand component
 * standing on stock primitives, with no mineral tokens and no pill buttons, and nothing
 * anywhere reported a problem.
 *
 * Mzizi HAS its own button, card, badge, input, avatar and so on. If the registry ships
 * them, they are what a consumer of the registry must get. So there is no such thing as a
 * name we are happy to hand to another registry, and no list to maintain.
 *
 * The addressable forms are an absolute URL (works everywhere, what the manifest uses now)
 * and `@mzizi/<name>` (pinnable, needs a `registries` mapping in the consumer's
 * components.json — which a registry:base cannot write, so the CLI and template app do it).
