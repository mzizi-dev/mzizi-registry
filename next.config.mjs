  // It stood in this file until #274 and meant `next build` — the step that
  // produces what users actually get — compiled and shipped regardless of type
  // errors. `pnpm typecheck` was the only real gate, and it is a convention
  // (pre-commit hook) plus a CI job the deploy does not depend on.
  //
  // Without the flag Next runs `tsc` itself as part of the build, over a
  // tsconfig that includes `.next/types/**` — the generated route types. CI's
  // `Type Check` job runs `pnpm typecheck` on a bare checkout, where that
  // directory does not exist yet, so those generated types are only ever
  // checked here. Do not put the flag back: it removes the last gate the
  // deploy path has of its own.

  // `outputFileTracingIncludes` stood here, naming `components/registry/**` for
  // six routes. It existed because `@/lib/registry-source` read those files at
  // request time with `readdir` + `readFileSync` — dynamic reads Next's static
  // trace cannot see, so without the hint the reads succeeded in `next dev` and
  // 404'd in a Vercel lambda.
  //
  // Nothing reads them at request time any more. The source is inlined into
  // `lib/registry-source.generated.json` at build time, and every remaining
  // `components/registry/...` reference is a static import the bundler resolves.
  // The hint now describes a mechanism this app no longer has, which is the
  // reason to delete it: a comment asserting request-time filesystem reads is
  // how the next person concludes the Vercel coupling is still real.
  //
  // It buys no size back, and that was checked rather than assumed. All 609
  // files are still traced into `.open-next/server-functions/default/` without
  // it — Next reaches them through the static imports — and the Worker upload
  // is unchanged at ~6.9 MB gzipped either way. This is a correctness cleanup,
  // not an optimisation.

  // a 404, which is worse than the original URL. `/tokens` is the
  // foundations surface that actually exists, so they point there.
  //
  // `/architecture/layers/:n` → `/architecture/nodes/:n`. The unit did not
  // change, its name did: what the axis era called layer N is node N on
  // the DNA double helix (§6.2). A redirect — not a 410 — because the
  // destination genuinely holds the same content, and existing inbound
  // links and crawler history should land on it rather than dead-end.
  // The node itself may not exist; `/architecture/nodes/[n]` decides that
  // by asking the collection, never a capped range.
  // ── The API's own hostname ───────────────────────────────────────────

  // `api.mzizi.dev` is a custom domain on THIS Worker, and it serves the

  // references across this repo, the MCP, the console and every published
  // install command were migrated to it, and the shadcn `registryDependencies`
  // of 804 components resolve through it transitively.
  //
  // The `/api` segment was an artifact of the API sharing the apex with the
  // site. It does not survive the split: `mzizi.dev` becomes the human site
  // and the API gets its own hostname, so the prefix is absorbed by the
  // hostname rather than repeated in the path.
  //
  // A rewrite, not a redirect, on purpose. `npx shadcn add` follows a chain
  // of absolute dependency URLs, and a 308 on each hop is latency a consumer
  // pays for our URL history. Both shapes answer, so nothing that already
  // works stops working.
